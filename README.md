# SQL-for-Data-Science
First course in the 'Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization' offered by University of Califronia, Davis.
This course is designed to give you a primer in the fundamentals of SQL and working with data so that you can begin analyzing it for data science purposes. 
Learning Objectives:
- Distinguish between use of SQL for data science applications and SQL for more common data management operations.
- Identify a subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and write a SQL query to limit to those outcome.
- Understanding how WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, OR, NOT, LIKE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY works. using the wildcard function to search for more specific or parts of records, including their advantages and disadvantages, and how best to utilize them
